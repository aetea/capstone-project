a sense of what life looks like there through various quality-of-life 
scores, and find out what travel restrictions are present during COVID-19. 

# Features

healthcare, internet access and leisure & culture. 10/10 is best! 

City information and scores are shown at the urban area level. For example: San Francisco, 
Berkeley and San Jose all belong to the urban area "San Francisco Bay Area".
